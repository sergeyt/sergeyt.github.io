## Work Experience

### 2016 - present, Full Stack Engineer, [Xored](http://www.xored.com/)

I was working as Full Stack developer on [Spirent Velocity](https://www.spirent.com/Products/velocity) automation platform. This is a very complex project having a huge frontend implemented in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Historically [alt.js](http://alt.js.org/) was selected as classical implementation of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) approach and primary solution for state management. Since 2017 I've initiated integration of Redux as replacement of legacy alt.js. And now we are happily migrating to Redux.

Keywords: Linux, Java, JavaScript, React, Redux, Flux, Golang, Python, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Docker, OpenStack

### 2007 - 2016, Full Stack Engineer, [DataWorks](http://dataworks.co/)

I was being a part of super dev team that working on development of huge reporting system called [Active Reports](https://www.grapecity.com/en/activereports). Here I've made a significant contribution rewriting report engine that dramatically boosts performance of the engine. Also contributed to development of ActiveReports Server. 

Here we even crafted a binary cross-compiler from .NET byte-code to Adobe Flash Player byte-code just to implement Active Reports Flash Viewer and this viewer was popular some time :) I was primary author of this cross-compiler coding major part of it.

Keywords: .NET, C#, JavaScript, RDL, Reporting, Data Retrieving and Processing, Windows, IIS

### 2002 - 2007, Software Engineer, [IAE](http://www.iae.nsk.su/index.php/en)

Here as PhD student I've implemented hardware abstraction layer to control multiple devices of Circle Laser Writing System created and designed by IAE. This module allows creation of multiple device configurations, then you can easily load given configuration at runtime without recompilation of control program. This significantly reduced time and cost on testing all laboratory devices and debugging of control program on configurations with device emulators.

Keywords: C++, C#, Windows Driver Clients, Computed Aided Tomography, Software for Interferometer & Profilometer Devices
