## Work Experience

### 2016 - present, [Xored](http://www.xored.com/)

Working on [Spirent Velocity](https://www.spirent.com/Products/velocity) automation platform.
This is a very complex project having a huge frontend implemented in [React](https://reactjs.org/).
Historically [alt.js](http://alt.js.org/) was selected as classical implementation of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) approach and solution for state management. Since 2017 I've initiated integration of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as replacement of legacy alt.js. Now we are still migrating to Redux.

### 2007 - 2016, [DataWorks](http://dataworks.co/)

I was being a part of super dev team that working on development of huge reporting system now called [Active Reports](https://www.grapecity.com/en/activereports).
Here I've made a significant contribution rewriting report engine that dramatically boosts performance of the engine.
